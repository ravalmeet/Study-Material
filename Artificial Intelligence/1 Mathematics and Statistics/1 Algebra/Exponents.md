# Exponents in Algebra for Machine Learning

## Introduction
Exponents play a crucial role in algebra, forming the foundation for various mathematical operations. In the context of machine learning, a solid understanding of exponents is essential. This README provides a brief overview of key concepts related to exponents in algebra for machine learning.

## Basic Rules
- **Product Rule:** \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m + n}\)
- **Quotient Rule:** \(\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}\)
- **Power Rule:** \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\)

## Negative and Zero Exponents
- \(a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}\)
- \(a^0 = 1\) (except when \(a = 0\))

## Scientific Notation
Writing large or small numbers in the form \(a \times 10^n\), where \(1 \leq a < 10\) and \(n\) is an integer.

## Exponential Functions
Functions of the form \(f(x) = a \cdot b^x\), where \(a\) is a constant and \(b > 1\) (growth) or \(0 < b < 1\) (decay).

## Logarithms
The inverse operation of exponentiation. If \(b^y = x\), then \(\log_b(x) = y\).

## Applications in Machine Learning
Exponents and logarithms are frequently used in machine learning algorithms, especially in optimization problems and modeling exponential growth or decay.

## Practice Problems
1. Simplify the expression: \(2^5 \cdot 2^3\).
2. Evaluate the following: \(\frac{5^4}{5^2}\).
3. Find the value of \(3^{2 \times 4}\).
4. Calculate \(2^{-3}\).
5. Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(4^x = 64\).
6. Express \(1000\) in scientific notation.
7. Given the function \(g(x) = 3 \cdot 2^x\), calculate \(g(2)\).
