# Factorials in Algebra for Machine Learning

## Introduction
Factorials are essential mathematical operations frequently encountered in algebra and other mathematical disciplines. In the context of machine learning, understanding factorials is crucial for various applications. This README provides a brief overview of factorials in algebra for machine learning.

## Definition
The factorial of a non-negative integer \(n\), denoted by \(n!\), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \(n\).

### Example:
\[ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \]

## Basic Properties
- \(0! = 1\)
- \(n! = n \times (n-1) \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1\)

## Applications in Machine Learning
Factorials find applications in combinatorics, probability, and various algorithms in machine learning, such as in permutation and combination calculations.

## Practice Problems
1. Calculate \(4!\).
2. Find the value of \(0!\).
3. Evaluate \(6! \div 2!\).
4. Determine the number of permutations of a set of 3 distinct elements.
5. Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 5 (combination).
6. Find \(8! - 7!\).
7. Determine the factorial value of \(10\).
8. Calculate the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word "MACHINE".
