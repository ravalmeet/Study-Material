# Summations in Algebra for Machine Learning

## Introduction
Summations are fundamental in algebra and play a crucial role in various mathematical operations. Understanding summations is essential in machine learning, particularly in analyzing algorithms and expressing mathematical series. This README provides a brief overview of key concepts related to summations in algebra for machine learning.

## Basics of Summations
- A summation represents the addition of a sequence of numbers.
- The symbol \( \sum \) is used to denote a summation.
- Example: \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \) represents the sum of integers from 1 to \( n \).

## Properties and Formulas
- **Arithmetic Series:** \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (a + (i-1)d) = \frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d] \)
- **Geometric Series:** \( \sum_{i=0}^{n} ar^i = a \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \)

## Practice Problems
1. Evaluate: \( \sum_{i=1}^{5} (2i + 1) \)
2. Find the sum of the first 10 terms in the arithmetic series: \( \sum_{i=1}^{10} (3 + 2i) \).
3. Calculate: \( \sum_{i=0}^{3} 2^i \).
4. Determine the sum of the first 6 terms in the geometric series: \( \sum_{i=0}^{5} 4 \cdot 3^i \).
5. Simplify the expression: \( \sum_{i=2}^{4} (i^2 - 1) \).
6. Find the value of \( n \) that satisfies: \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = 45 \).
7. Express the following geometric series in sigma notation: \( 2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + \ldots \).
